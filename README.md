## Welcome!
**This repository consists of a simple script with Python code to reproduce QSAR models presented in the publication:**

*"Hybrid machine learning and experimental studies of antivirucidal potential of ionic liquids against P100, MS2, and Phi6"*
by Szymon Zdybel, Anita Sosnowska, Dominika Kowalska, Julia Sommer, Beate Conrady, Patrick Mester, Maciej Gromelski and Tomasz Puzyn

Contents:
- ILS-SETS.xlsx - contains 3 sheets with data necessary to reproduce the models
- script.ipynb - simple Jupyter notebook script with Python code to reproduce the models, the script fits models, performs predictions
               for the training/validation sets and generates classification report. These generated results are sufficient to reproduce any
               plot, graph and remaining statistics presented in the publication. 
- LICENSE - self explanatory
- requirements.txt - lists all libraries and their versions that were used to develop QSAR models
